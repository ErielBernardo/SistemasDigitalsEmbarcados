Code Red Technologies RDB1768 Board - Audio Level Meter
=======================================================

This demonstration project provides a simple example that uses
the audio facilities provided by the RDB1768. It also makes use
of the LCD screen to display a meter showing levels for the audio
being received. 

To run the example, you will need to connect an audio source,
such as an MP3 player, to the 3.5mm line-in socket of the RDB1768.

The audio signal received can then be redirected to the built-in
speaker of the RDB1768 by moving switch S2-2 (Audio-SP) to the right.

Alternatively, connected a set of headphones or external speakers to
the 3.5mm headphones socket of the RDB1768.

Note that in order to build this example, you will need to have the
LCDlib project installed in the same workspace.
