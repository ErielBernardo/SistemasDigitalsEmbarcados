Code Red Technologies RDB1768 Board - User Leds Demo
====================================================

This demonstration project show how the user leds, LED_2 to
LED_5, of the RDB1768 be accessed.

The project defines a number of functions to switch the leds
on and off, individually and as a group, and also to invert the
current state of the leds. The demonstration itself then calls
these functions to flash the leds in various combinations.
